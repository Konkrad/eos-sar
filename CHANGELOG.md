# [Unreleased](https://github.com/Kayrros/eos-sar/compare/0.43.1..HEAD)

# [0.43.1](https://github.com/Kayrros/eos-sar/compare/0.43.0..0.43.1)

## Added
- s1:metadata: Add S1C relative orbit formulas pre/post manoeuver
  * You should update to 0.43.1 if you use S1C products acquired after 2026-06-16.
  * `eos.products.sentinel1.metadata.relative_orbit_number_from_absolute` signature changed (new parameter `acquisition_date`), update your code if you use this function on recent products.
  * See https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/news/2026-5-28-sentinel-1-orbital-reconfiguration-dates for more information about the manoeuver.

# [0.43.0](https://github.com/Kayrros/eos-sar/compare/0.42.1..0.43.0)

## Added
- test_s1_productinfo: Add a test for relative orbit in manifest vs formula
- metadata: Add S1D relative orbit formula
- usage: Add S1 SLC cropping and simulation script
- tests: Add nisar rtc test
- usage: Add usage for nisar crop+simulation
- nisar:proj_model: Add coordinate property

## Changed
- dem: Simplify code for subsetted dem transform
- simulator: expose DEM resampling parameter
- change license to Apache 2.0
- README: Update readme
- tutorial: Use CDSE backend instead of pre-downloading with ASF
- usage: Clarify usage of all scripts
- phoenix:  Remove phoenix:
  * Changes in `grd_rtc_slicing.py`: some code was exclusively done with the Phoenix backend. It was moved out, but not replaced. It should be replaced in the future with a CDSE backend. Also the `ANX` file that was available via phoenix is no longer available. An alternative must be found.
  * Changes in `teosar.tsinsar`: `main` and `main_ovl` : previously, when the backend_factory was None (or product_provider is None or orbit_backend is None for `main_ovl` ) , the fallback was `PhoenixBackendFactory`. Now, this behavior is removed, and these input parameters can no longer be optional Therefore, the signature of `main` and `main_ovl` has been modified.
  * A `test_teosar.py` test has been added.
- osio: Replace osio with a slower* fsspec implementation:
  * osio was removed
  * Functions `open_netcdf_osio` and `open_image_osio` were removed.
  * The biggest impact is on NISAR which solely used osio previously for remote reading (s3 and http).
  * It was replaced with fsspec (with s3 and http backends).
  * *The current fsspec implementation is a bit slower than osio (for s3, but faster for http). The current fsspec implementation is a temporary fix for osio. Caching is not optimized yet. The recommendation for NISAR (in the product specification) have not been implemented yet.
  * **Breaking change**: `eos.products.nisar.cropper` contains many functions whose signature has been modified, namely `get_primary_crop`, `get_primary_crop_dem_registLUT`, `get_secondary_crop`, `crop_images`. All of this is fine since NISAR developement is ongoing, the function signature is not stabilized.
- package: Change package name to eos-sar
- CI: use Github Actions instead of Gitlab CI

## Fixed
- dem: Fix dem-stitcher bounds edge case:
    * In an edge case when you request a dem with lat_min and lon_max close to
    * the tile limits but exceeding it by half a pixel (1x1 degree tiling), the resulting dem
    * would be smaller than expected, i.e. dem-stitcher did not fetch data
    * from neighboring tiles. This is because the tile bounds dataset in
    * dem-stitcher is wrongly translated by half a pixel to the east and half a pixel
    * to the south. This bug has been corrected, we now fetch a slightly
    * bigger dem and then subset it.
- tests: Fix test_grd_cropper where values changed because of dem-stitcher change
- simulator: Fix gcp coords before estimating transform
- simulator: Fix 0.5 pixel shift in Simulator.simulate
- dem: Fix DemStitcherSource to avoid 0.5 pix shifts
- roi_provider: Fix CentroidRoiProvider assertion to account for numpy types
- teosar: Fix periodogram.cl packaging and add a test:
  * closes ISSUE #183
- teosar: Fix boto3 import:
  * boto3 is not a dependency, it is now only imported in the class that needs it.
- usage/zoom: Fix script and remove osio

## Removed
- s3_bucket: Remove kayrros s3 bucket from tests:

  * S3 bucket: No more tests use the Kayrros S3 bucket. When Sentinel-1 data is required, now CDSE backend is used instead of the bucket. The only tests that could use a bucket are `test_mask_border_noise_grd.py` and `test_calibration.py` which require large files corresponding to SNAP results. For now, the comparison against SNAP results has been removed entirely from the code, and will be added back once we have a public location to store test data. To reduce the load on CDSE, some fixtures are used. We also switch to a slower gitlab runner. We run the CDSE tests separately on a single worker. We also mark tests using CDSE fixtures as flaky, so that we can easily retry them.
  * As for the NISAR tests, they now only use the public http sample links, so they are a bit slower than before.

- s1m: Remove s1m:

  * `s1m` was only used for a single test, which was moved;

- multidem: Remove multidem dependency:

  * dem: `eos.dem.get_any_source()` will not give multidem anymore. This is fine as will be explained below.

  * The code using this function might now behave differently, here is a list:

    ```
    - usage/zoom.py: dem_source = eos.dem.get_any_source()
    - src/teosar/tsinsar.py: dem_source = eos.dem.get_any_source()
    - src/teosar/tsinsar.py: dem_source = eos.dem.get_any_source()
    - src/eos/products/sentinel1/assembler.py: dem_source = eos.dem.get_any_source()
    - tests/test_rtc.py: dem_source = eos.dem.get_any_source()
    - tests/test_localize_without_alt.py: dem_source = eos.dem.get_any_source()
    - tests/test_ortho.py: dem = model.fetch_dem(eos.dem.get_any_source(), roi)
    - tests/test_projection.py: dem_source = eos.dem.get_any_source()
    - tests/test_geom_phase.py: dem_source = eos.dem.get_any_source()
    - tests/test_resampling_stitching.py: dem_source = eos.dem.get_any_source()
    ```

  * The tests listed above pass. One test that did not pass (not listed) is `tests/test_radarcoding.py`and it has been modified to pass by increasing a margin. The assembler entry corresponds to the `Sentinel1AssemblyCropper.crop` method. For this method, as well as `src/teosar/tsinsar`, this function is only used when `dem_source` is None, which should not be the case in any prod environement, so this is fine.

- CI: Remove deploy stage

# [0.41.0](https://github.com/Kayrros/eos-sar/compare/0.40.0..0.41.0) -- 2025-08-06

## Added
- grd cropper: `process` now returns a CropMetadata object, which allows to retrieve the LOS angles of the center of the crop
- tests: Add tests for validity of localize_without_alt
- test_dem: Add some tests for dem interpolation

## Changed
- model: Change get_approx_geom and get_buffered_geom behavior:
    * This is a consequence of the change of behavior of localize without alt,
    * which now is more prone to returning invalid results. All functions
    * using it must check the validity mask and decide to raise an exception
    * or not on a case by case basis.
- dem: Move some interpolation code into DEM.interpolate_array
- localize_without_alt and DEM.elevation: take into account points falling outside of the DEM extent thus avoiding costly DEM padding

## Fixed

    change in behaviour of eos.sar.utils.stitch_array which now can stich
    arrays with arbitrary number of channels as long as their height and width
    respects the writing rois.
- geoconfig: Add function for squinted LOS
- range_doppler: Add support for non zero Doppler in projection
    change in eos.sar.range_doppler in iterative_projection and get_E_dE
    which now can take as input (optionally) the doppler centroid
    scaled by half the wavelength. This is necessary to estimate
    the time along the orbit that corresponds to a non zero Doppler frequency
- chore: add compiled .c to gitignore
- geoconfig: Add code to predict los with tests

- grd_cropper: better estimation of the Roi:
    * and reduce area of the fetched dem
- ortho: improve DEM subsetting:
    * Using get_approx_geom was prone to issues, in particular for DEM
    * containing nans but not only. In eos.sar.ortho we know the destination
    * AOI, we don't have to rely on sensor geometry to subset the DEM.
- s1/grd_cropper: improve invalid alignment exception message

## Fixed
- ortho: fix typos and unnecessary call
- tests/grd_cropper: assert that the rasters do not contain nans

# [0.31.0](https://github.com/Kayrros/eos-sar/compare/0.30.1..0.31.0) -- 2024-12-04

## Added
- grd_cropper: support product assembly and CDSE products
- tests: add `cdse_s3_session` fixture
- ferreti_2001: Added CL+TF periodo for atmospheric estimation
- usage: Add small periodogram example
- periodogram: Add class that performs CL + TF periodogram
- teosar/ferreti: Add helper to call periodogram_cl
- teosar/periodogram: Add alternative OpenCL periodogram code:
    * The code enables to create your own periodogram functions,
    * and test in parallel on GPU or CPU for a lot of PS many
    * input values in order to maximize the periodogram.
    * 
    * This implementation currently only supports the simple
    * periodogram with 2 variables to optimize, but the core
    * of the code supports more, and it should be simple to
    * add support for more configurations.

## Changed

- teosar:workflow: Catch BursterException
- ferreti_2001: Run a loop if ncpu=1
- teosar:workflow: Catch Secondary Exceptions:
    * We expect the secondary pipeline to run on many products, thus, instead of interrupting the program if a problem occurs for a product, we catch the exception  in the execute function and issue a Warning. This choice is debatable and lies on the assumption that a few products might raise exceptions, but we might want the result on the other products anyway.
- periodgram_par:tf: Suppress some warnings
- ferreti_2001: Simplify import of PeriodogramPar/CL
- teosar: Expose Periodogram in init
- teosar: Simplify tf and add siphash
- ferreti_2001: Rename func gamma_inference
- periodogram_cl: Rename class PeriodogramCL
- teosar/ferreti: Overhaul of the tensorflow path:
    * Use a first pass with exhaustive search in order
    * to improve the quality of the results. Use the
    * new opencl path for speed.
    * 
    * Rewrite the tensorflow code to treat each element
    * individually rather than in group.
    * 
    * This accelerates compilation, computation and
    * limits resource usage.
- ci: install setuptools to package for 3.12

## Fixed
- s1 product: fix extract_ipf for GRD COG products:
    * Indeed it was picking up the version of the "GRD COGififier" and not the S1 processor,
    * causing problem in the calibration noise removal.
- snap: Fix reader when 2 products are read
- fix:periodogram.cl: Fix bug that was skipping some variable tuples
- periodogram.cl: Fix typo in docstring
- teosar: Fix dependencies
- teosar: Fix weights convention

    * been updated, and the usage as well. Support for s1-burster needs to be
    * added.
- Added usage for debursting
- Added some usage functionnalities
- Added intersection of bursts.:
    * When doing interferometry, the sentinel1 swath may contain different
    * burst relative ids (spatial location) in the secondary image ( usually
    * it may happen to have a burst translation from a product to another, or
    * just some additional bursts). The common bursts can be found by the
    * added function.
- Added deburst module:
    * The deburst module, along with the Sentine1Swath Model now enable us to
    * deduce the regions that need to be read from each burst to get an aoi.
    * Furthermore, these regions are adapted to the secondary location, are
    * read, resampled and debursted.
- Added some debursting capabilites
- Added possibility of resampling a roi within a burst
- Added roi manipulation functions
- Added support for Swath projection:
    * Sentinel1 projection is now more generic. The only difference between a
    * swath and a burst is in the origin times and positions. The actual
    * physical sensor model algorithm with bistatic and apd correction is the
    * same.

# [0.2.0](https://github.com/Kayrros/eos-sar/compare/0.1.0..0.2.0) -- 2021-08-17

## Added
- src: add __init__.py files to fix packaging
- S1 metadata: add burst attribute "bsid":
    * it is just the concatenation of the `relative_burst_id` and the `swath`
- S1 metadata: add functions to parse precise orbit's state_vectors

## Changed
- bump to 0.2.0
- S1 metadata: adjust T_pre for IW2 and IW3
- S1 metadata: adjust T_pre (with supporting tests)
- S1 metadata: adjust T_pre for IW2 (with supporting tests)
- S1 metadata: check against all burstId samples from ESA

## Fixed
- tests: fix indentation
- S1 metadata: fix burst id computation when changing orbits


# [0.1.0](https://github.com/Kayrros/eos-sar/compare/..0.1.0) -- 2021-07-08

## Added
- S1 metadata: add function extract_burst_metadata and fix tests
- tests: add tests from the IPF 3.9 draft (burst id)
- S1 metadata: add 'swath' field
- Added metadata reading from xml.:
    * s1m dependency has been removed. Metadata reading is now performed
    * directly from an xml file content as string.
- Added initialization from meta
- Added usage
- Added deramping and reramping:
    * Resampling a complex burst requires deramping, resampling, reramping.
- Added io function
- Added Deramping/Reramping
- Added affine registration estimation:
    * A (sensor) generic affine regist matrix estimation has been added.
    * Points on the dem are projected on both images, and the matrix is then
    * estimated. A resampling function is also provided. Deramping and
    * reramping still need to be implemented.
- Added requirements
- Added some tests
- Added creation from s1m
- Added products
- burst metadata: add attributes azimuth_anx_time and lon_lat_bbox:
    * this requires the future latest s1m version
- Add burst localization function:
    * It is now possible to localize from the burst coordinate system +
    * altitude to lon, lat. APD correction and Bistatic correction is
    * supported. It has been verified that this function is the inverse of
    * projection.
- Added orbit param for projection:
    * In burstprojection, it is now possible to pass the function a fitted
    * orbit, this way we avoid fitting the polynomial coefficients each time
    * the projection function is called.
- Added const module:
    * Constants are now stored in a const module. Each constant name is formed
    * by joining the physical meaning with the unit ( all in uppercase) using
    * underscores.
- Added burst projection:
    * The projection into a sentinel1 burst has been added here. The burst is
    * referenced to its first valid line and column. The metadata is extracted
    * using s1m for a product/subswath and burst index.
- Added backprojection:
    * Low level functions for projection and localisation common to all sar
    * satellites using state-vectors and focused to Zero-Doppler. Two
    * different implementations of projection available for use.
- Added Chebychev orbit interpolation:
    * Ephemerides in the metadata is given as state vectors,a list of samples
    * (time, position, speed). Interpolation can be done using chebychev
    * polynomials

## Changed
- metadata: small cleanup
- Modified metadata reading:
    * It is now possible to read the metadata for multiple bursts at once. The
    * common metadata (relating to the swath and the sensor) are read once.
    * However, they are still stored multiple times ( in each burst
    * dictionnary). This might change later.
- S1 metadata: compute relative and absolute burst ids:
    * the computation was calibrated and validated against the three products provided as samples:

    * 
    * further testing will be required once the IPF is used to generate the SLC products
- regist: use cv2.warpAffine to apply the affine transform
- Reformated files for readability
- Adapted meta reading for test
- Sentinel1BurstResample: reduce memory usage:
    * to register a complete burst:
    * before: 5231MB
    * after: 2377MB
- Fixed test for s1m master
- Fixed small typo in readme
- Update README.md
- Modified io
- Improved code readability
- Separated registration steps:
    * It is now possible to read the dem in a step. The we need to project in
    * primary frame ourselves. The we call orbital_regist to project in
    * secondary frame. This separation is for practical computational purpose
    * so we can reuse dem and projected points on all secondary bursts.
- Modified requirements
- Fixed projection test
- Ensured coherence of variables:
    * Most important change: projection and localization now deals with row,
    * col in this order.
    * Image coordinates named row, col. Can be converted to azt, rng.
    * geocentric coordinates gx, gy, gz. 3D coordinates x, y, alt.
    * Other parts of the code have been cleaned, and tests adapted.
- Fixed Docstring
- Fixed init
- Filled S1BurstModel
- init
- Separated generic and S1 algos
- Renamed backproj to range_doppler
- Switched to row col convention
- Fixed spelling and readability
- Performed min, max on list
- Formatted with AutoPEP8
- Vectorized localization function:
    * solve_range_doppler is now vectorized
- Cleaned localization formulas:
    * Formulas used for the localization are now prettier. We also avoid
    * copying the constants into local vars. solve_range_doppler signature is
    * also changed.
- Reformatted Docstring
- Change Orbit evaluate method:
    * A single method is now implemented to evaluate the position, speed,
    * acceleration and higher order derivatives along the orbit
- Replaced epsg by crs:
    * The epsg int identifiers might not always work.
    * Thus, we repalced by crs string in burst_projection.
- Forced user to pass orbit to proj & loc func:
    * User is now forced to pass a fitted Orbit instance to burst_projection
    * and burst_localization instead of having the option to fit the orbit
    * inside the functions from the burst_metadata.
- Fixed docstring and camelCase:
    * Docstring is now formatted uniformly in all modules. camleCase functions
    * renamed.
- Fixed imports
