"""Sentinel-1 SLC and GRD product reading and processing.

Submodules cover reading SAFE product metadata and rasters, orbit state
vectors, calibration/denoising, deburst and slant-range-to-ground-range
(SRGR) conversion, coregistration/burst resampling, geometric sensor
models, border-noise masking, and product assembly/mosaicking.
